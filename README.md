# FlashCard App

The Flashcard app started plainly as a normal flashcard that provides questions as well as their answers at the back of the card, but the idea quickly changed into what I call "The Riddler".

## Features

- Flexible configuration: User can decide what they want to be quizzed on and also set the amount of questions they'll like to answer
- Cummulative Score at the end of the quiz as well as users answers plus the correct answer.
